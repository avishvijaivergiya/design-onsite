# HealthBook Animation System

A comprehensive animation system for the HealthBook UI components, designed to create smooth, consistent, and meaningful interactions.

## Core Animation Principles

### 1. Timing
- Base transition speed: 200ms
- Easing function: cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)
- Dynamic timing for content transitions: 100ms per element (capped at 400ms)

### 2. Scale Transforms
- Hover scale: 1.02 (2% increase)
- Active/Click scale: 1.05 (5% increase)
- All scale transforms maintain the element's original position

### 3. Content Transitions
- New content slides in from top with fade
- Existing content smoothly shifts down
- Transition duration based on content size
- Smooth height animations for expanding/collapsing elements

### 2. Shape-Shifting System
Components can transform between rounded and square shapes based on interaction states:

#### Round to Square

#### Square to Round

## Animation Classes

### Base Scale Animation
- Use for elements that should scale on hover/active states
- Automatically handles transform transitions
- Example: `<div class="animate-scale">Scalable Content</div>`

### Content Shift System

- Use for elements that need to animate in/out
- Handles height, opacity, and position transitions
- Example: `<div class="content-shift">Dynamic Content</div>`

## Component-Specific Animations

### Buttons
- Scale up on hover (2%)
- Scale up further on click (5%)
- Smooth color transitions
- Hardware-accelerated transforms

### Form Inputs
- Scale up slightly on focus
- Smooth border color transitions
- Subtle hover states

### Checkboxes & Radio Buttons
- Scale up on hover
- Smooth state transitions
- Custom check/radio animations

### Dropdowns
- Scale up on focus
- Smooth border transitions
- Custom arrow animation

### 3. Interactive Animations
Common scale animations for interactive elements:

### 1. Filter Buttons
- Start with fully rounded corners
- Transform to square corners on focus/click
- Scale on hover
- Return to original shape on blur

### 3. Time Slots
- Square corners by default
- Transform to round on focus/click
- Scale on hover
- Disabled state for booked slots

### 4. Doctor Cards
- Scale on hover
- Smooth transitions for all interactive elements
- Maintains shape during interactions

## Loading States

### Skeleton Loading
- Smooth loading states for cards and filters
- Maintains layout during loading
- Automatic transition to content
- Rounded corners match final component shapes

## Modal Interactions

### Booking Modal
- Smooth entry with fade and transform
- Shape-shifting form controls
- Animated confirmation screen
- Auto-dismissal after booking

### Confirmation Animation
- Animated checkmark drawing
- Smooth transitions between states
- Green success indication

## Usage

1. Include the animation system:

## Animation Rules

1. **Scale Rule**
   - Elements scale up on hover/focus
   - Scale amount is proportional to element size
   - Larger elements use smaller scale factors

2. **Content Timing Rule**
   - Transition time = 100ms Ã— number of elements
   - Maximum transition time capped at 400ms
   - Minimum transition time is 200ms

3. **Content Shift Rule**
   - New content pushes existing content down
   - Transitions are smooth and proportional
   - Content shifts maintain document flow

4. **Hardware Acceleration**
   - Use `will-change: transform` for performance
   - Apply to elements with frequent animations
   - Remove when animations complete

## Best Practices

1. **Performance**
- Use transform and opacity for animations
- Avoid animating layout properties
- Keep transitions short and smooth

2. **Accessibility**
- Maintain focus visibility
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Don't rely solely on hover states

3. **Consistency**
- Use provided CSS variables
- Maintain consistent timing
- Follow established patterns

4. **Progressive Enhancement**
- Animations don't break functionality
- Fallback states for older browsers
- Graceful degradation

## Browser Support
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Fallback to non-animated states in older browsers

## Implementation Example

3. Add animation classes:
